This project was inspired by my cantonese class at UC Berkeley. I had always wanted to learn cantonese, my heritage language, but never found the time to commit myself to learning it. 

I began developing an excel spreadsheet as a dictionary to translate words. but lets see here

Additionally, the database to be able to easily convert from jyutpin to yale romanisation with tones and numbres. 

I now wanted to extend this projec to utilise existing databases across the web. 
idk how copyright works with using these so i'll look into that when i get up to it.

"As a side note, CC-Canto is not mentioned because that dictionary is very small and also of a very low quality with lots of errors."


Databases to explore for future (ranked in order):
https://cantowords.com/faiman/analysis/ - json or csv, may need to clean data for this one
https://jyutdictionary.com/ - database file
https://cantonese.org/download.html - in txt format with numbered tones
